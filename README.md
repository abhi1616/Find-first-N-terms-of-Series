# Find-first-N-terms-of-Series
The problem contains a series in which few terms of given and we need to understand the logic among terms and print series.

This file contain code as solution to the given problem.

## Problem : 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5, 3, 7, 5, 11, 8, 13, 13, 17, ... print this series in python language.
## Solution : 
Looking above series, 
1, 2, 
1, 3, 
2, 5, 
3, 7, 
5, 11, 
8, 13, 
13, 17, ...
and so on

As we can see above series is nothing but a combination of two different series,
#### 1. Fibonacci Series
#### 2. Prime Numbers

So, this code is basically nothing but zips two series and prints.
