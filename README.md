# Find-first-N-terms-of-Series
The problem contains a series in which few terms of given and we need to understand the logic among terms and print series.

This file contain code as solution to the given problem.

## Problem : 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5, 3, 7, 5, 11, 8, 13, 13, 17, ... print this series in python language.
## Solution : <br>
Looking at above series, <br>
1, 2, <br>
1, 3, <br>
2, 5, <br>
3, 7, <br>
5, 11, <br>
8, 13, <br>
13, 17, ...<br>
and so on

As we can see above series is nothing but a combination of two different series, <br>
#### 1. Fibonacci Series <br>
#### 2. Prime Numbers <br>

So, this code is basically nothing but zips two series and prints.
